        Agent Phillip J. Coulson (/ˈkoʊlsən/ KOHL-sən) is a fictional character portrayed and voiced
        by Clark Gregg in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise. Coulson is depicted
        as a high-ranking member of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and longtime partner of Nick
        Fury.

      <p>
        After being killed by Loki and the Avengers form to avenge him, Fury has Coulson resurrected
        with Kree blood to continue serving S.H.I.E.L.D., putting together a small team of agents
        supervised by Melinda May and coming to view one agent, Daisy Johnson, as a surrogate
        daughter. After rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. following its infiltration and destruction by Hydra,
        saving the planet, and making a deal with a demon to briefly become Ghost Rider, stripping
        him of the blood keeping him alive, Coulson retires to Tahiti with May, where he dies once
        again.

        Following the destruction of Sarge, a biological duplicate of Coulson created by a monolith
        and inhabited by the Aztec god Pachakutiq, a Life Model Decoy (L.M.D.) of Coulson is made
        from a copy of his consciousness saved to a virtual reality, and Sarge&apos;s and May&apos;s
        genetic memories, resurrecting him again. After preventing an alternate timeline from being
        conquered by Chronicoms, Coulson decides to travel the world in his flying car, Lola.

        Coulson was a central figure in the &quot;Infinity Saga&quot;, appearing in five films, two
        television series, one digital series, and two Marvel One-Shots, most notably in The
        Avengers (2012) and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020). Several versions of Coulson from
        within the MCU multiverse also appear, notably in the live-action series Agents of
        S.H.I.E.L.D. and the animated series What If...? (2021), with Gregg reprising the role.

        Coulson has additionally appeared in several forms of non-MCU media, being integrated into
        the mainstream Marvel Universe, initially modelled after Gregg and depicted as a
        S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and supporting character of Deadpool, before being redeveloped as a
        supervillain servant of the demon Mephisto and commander of the Squadron Supreme of America
        following his death and resurrection, and the main antagonist of &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;.
