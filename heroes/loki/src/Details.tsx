        Loki Laufeyson, known by adoption as Loki Odinson and by his title as the God of Mischief,
        is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
        media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse
        mythological god of the same name. Loki first appeared in Thor (2011) and has since become
        an important recurring figure of the MCU; following the original Loki&apos;s death in
        Avengers: Infinity War (2018), a variant of him from an alternate timeline is introduced in
        Avengers: Endgame (2019), diverging from the events of The Avengers (2012), headlining the
        television series Loki (2021) alongside Sylvie, a female variant of him who he works
        alongside with in the series.

        As of 2021, the character has appeared in six films, takes the lead role in the live-action
        series Loki (2021), with a number of alternate timeline variants appearing in Loki, the
        animated series What If...? (2021), and in The Good, the Bart, and the Loki (2021), an
        animated short film that serves as a crossover with The Simpsons franchise, including
        Classic Loki, Kid Loki, Boastful Loki, Alligator Loki, President Loki and more.

        Loki&apos;s character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across
        the history of the character in Marvel Comics. As in the comics, Loki has generally been a
        villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer Asgard or Earth, and having allied
        himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for
        his adoptive brother Thor, and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and
        others, and to regularly return from apparent death. In his development through the series,
        he becomes less of a supervillain and more of an antihero.
