        Steven Grant Rogers, more commonly known as Steve Rogers, is a fictional character primarily
        portrayed by Chris Evans in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on the
        Marvel Comics character of the same name—commonly known by his alias, Captain America.
        Rogers is depicted as a World War II-era super soldier who was given a serum that provided
        him with superhuman abilities including enhanced durability, strength, and athleticism.
        During his fight against the Nazi secret organization Hydra, he became frozen in the Arctic
        for nearly seventy years until being revived in the 21st century. Rogers becomes a founding
        member and leader of the Avengers. Following internal conflict within the Avengers as a
        result of the Sokovia Accords and Thanos initiating the Blip, Rogers leads the team on a
        final mission and they successfully restore trillions of lives across the universe and
        defeat Thanos. After returning the Infinity Stones to their original timelines, he remains
        in the 1940s with his lost love Peggy Carter; they marry and Rogers lives a full life. Upon
        his retirement, Rogers chooses Sam Wilson to be his successor and passes his shield and the
        title of Captain America onto him.

        Rogers is a central figure in the MCU, appearing in eleven films as of 2022. When first
        introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the character was received to mixed
        reception, but gradually became a fan favorite. The character of Steve Rogers is often
        cited, along with Robert Downey Jr.&apos;s Tony Stark, as cementing the success of the MCU.
        His story arc is considered to be one of the best in the MCU, and the Captain America films
        within the &quot;Infinity Saga&quot; are commonly referred to as the franchise&apos;s best
        trilogy. Chris Evans&apos; portrayal of Rogers has been met with acclaim and he has won
        numerous accolades.

        Alternate versions of Rogers from within the MCU multiverse also appear in the animated
        series What If...? (2021), voiced by Josh Keaton. These versions include an incarnation of
        Rogers who instead of receiving the serum, wears a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the
        Hydra Stomper.
