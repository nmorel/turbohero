        Natalia Alianovna Romanov (Russian: Наталья Альяновна Романов), more commonly known as
        Natasha Romanoff (Russian: Наташа Романова), is a fictional character primarily portrayed by
        Scarlett Johansson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on the
        Marvel Comics character of the same name—sometimes known by her alias, Black Widow. Romanoff
        is depicted as an expert spy and hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the Red Room from
        childhood to be a KGB assassin. This brings her under S.H.I.E.L.D.&apos;s radar, and Clint
        Barton is sent to kill her but instead spares her life and recruits her into the
        organization. When Nick Fury activates the Avengers Initiative, she becomes a founding
        member. Following the fallout related to the Sokovia Accords, Romanoff becomes a fugitive
        and eventually reunites with her adopted family, including sister Yelena Belova, and they
        work together to destroy General Dreykov&apos;s Black Widow program. After Thanos erases
        half of all life, Romanoff leads the Avengers for five years until she sacrifices herself,
        successfully helping the Avengers restore trillions of lives across the universe.

        Romanoff was introduced in Iron Man 2 (2010), and became a central MCU character, appearing
        in nine films until making her final live-action appearance in Black Widow (2021).
        Johansson&apos;s portrayal of Romanoff was met with positive reception.

        Alternate versions of the character appear in the animated series What If...? (2021), voiced
        by Lake Bell. These versions include an incarnation of Romanoff who sees her world decimated
        by an alternate version of Ultron, eventually resulting in her being recruited into the
        Guardians of the Multiverse by the Watcher.
