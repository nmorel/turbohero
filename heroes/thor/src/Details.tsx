        Thor Odinson, more commonly known as Thor, and sometimes by his title as the God of Thunder,
        is a fictional character portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
        media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse
        mythological god of the same name. In the MCU, he is depicted as one of the most powerful
        Asgardians, an ancient alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who humans consider to be
        gods. Thor wields a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, and is initially depicted as the
        arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among the Nine
        Realms under Asgard&apos;s protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous
        adopted brother, Loki. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth, and becomes a
        founding member of the Avengers. Thor eventually becomes the King of Asgard after
        Odin&apos;s death, but the entire realm is destroyed during Ragnar√∂k. Following the Blip, he
        passes the crown of New Asgard to Valkyrie and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.

        As of 2022, Thor is a central figure of the MCU, having appeared in eight films and will
        appear in the upcoming film Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). The character received a mixed
        reception in his first two titular films, however Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is often credited as
        positively rebooting Thor and his storyline, and he has since become a fan favorite.
