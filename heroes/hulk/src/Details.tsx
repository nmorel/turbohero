        Bruce Banner is a fictional character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise
        originally portrayed by Edward Norton and subsequently by Mark Ruffalo—based on the Marvel
        Comics character of the same name—known commonly by his alter ego, the Hulk. Banner is
        depicted as a genius physicist who after a failed experiment to replicate a super soldier
        program using gamma radiation, transforms into a large, muscular creature with green skin
        whenever his heart rate goes above 200 beats per minute or when facing mortal danger. As the
        Hulk, he possesses superhuman abilities including increased strength and durability. Over
        time, Banner demonstrates an increasing ability to control the transformation, and he
        becomes a founding member of the Avengers. Following the conflict with Ultron, Banner is
        unintentionally transported to Sakaar, where he remains the Hulk for a number of years until
        eventually returning to Earth to participate in the battle against Thanos. In the years
        after Thanos erases half of all life, Banner learns to retain the Hulk form with his mind
        still intact, and he is instrumental in the Avengers&apos; mission to use time travel to
        obtain the Infinity Stones from the past. After the Avengers succeed, Banner himself
        restores trillions of lives across the universe using the Stones in a specially made
        gauntlet.

        As of 2022, Banner has appeared in nine films after being introduced in the titular film The
        Incredible Hulk (2008). The character has been generally well-received by critics and
        audiences alike. However, Norton&apos;s recasting and Banner&apos;s inconsistent
        characterization throughout the franchise has drawn some criticism. Banner is set to return
        in the television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022).
