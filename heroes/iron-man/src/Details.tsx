        Anthony Edward Stark, more commonly known as Tony Stark, is a fictional character primarily
        portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based
        on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—commonly known by his alias, Iron Man. Stark
        is initially depicted as an industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy who is CEO of Stark
        Industries. Initially the chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, he has a change
        of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of
        armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world. He
        becomes a founding member and leader of the Avengers. Following his failed Ultron Program,
        the internal conflict within the Avengers due to the Sokovia Accords, and Thanos
        successfully erasing half of all life in the Blip, Stark retires, marries Pepper Potts, and
        they have a daughter named Morgan. However, Stark rejoins the Avengers on a final mission to
        undo Thanos&apos; actions. He creates time travel, and the Avengers successfully restore
        trillions of lives across the universe. However, Stark inevitably sacrifices his life to
        defeat Thanos and his army. Stark chooses Peter Parker as a successor.
