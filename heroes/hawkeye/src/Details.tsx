        Clinton Francis Barton, more commonly known as Clint Barton, is a fictional character
        portrayed by Jeremy Renner in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on
        the Marvel Comics character of the same name—commonly by his alias, Hawkeye. Barton is
        depicted as an expert marksman, archer and hand-to-hand combatant, with his preferred weapon
        being a recurve bow. Initially an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Barton is recruited by Steve Rogers
        and becomes a founding member of the Avengers. After Barton&apos;s family is decimated by
        Thanos, he becomes a vigilante and violently dismantles organized crime as Ronin until he
        and his allies revive those lost during the Blip. Despite his attempt to retire,
        Barton&apos;s time as Ronin causes continued conflicts with various elements of organized
        crime and he takes in a protégé named Kate Bishop.
